Ye Olde Source
==============

Hi there. I haven't released anything in a while. Here's some never-
before-seen source code from the p0laris project, specifically the
global-inject code. I'll write more of a README later.

`interpose` directory is entirely unmodified, straight from the
archives. All I did was remove the xcworkspace (paranoia), and binaries
(who wants those in git!).

The code is bad, I know. Janky-hacks on top of janky-hacks that were
never meant to see the light of day without a touch-up.

Listing
-------
```
README                        - this file

                                supposed to write
interpose/ent.xml             - entitlements for ldid and shit

                                setting DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES

                                inject code
interpose/src/game_over.m     - "updated" code, written in Objective-C
                                for some reason
